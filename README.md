# Origami
Project Name: 
**Peterâ€™s Origami**

# **Project Description:** 
**what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.**
Our project is a web page that tells the story of a child, Peter, that has Covid-19 and is bored of sitting home doing nothing. As a result, his mother recommends he work on some origami. The concept of our web page is to allow people to learn new skills but also learn how to do different simple origami. As origami is an exciting activity that can thankfully be done indoors, we believe this will add some joy to a somewhat boring life new-normal has brought us. We are striving to allow the user to interact with our web page using some interactive elements but also interact in real life with papers to create origami.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
We started by brainstorming for ideas. We wanted to create a web page that includes a video series that teaches the users how to do something. We finally decided to go with teaching the users how to do origami. Three different simple origami models were filmed. We chose models that are simple but have different difficulties as they will be fit for different group age users. Adult beginners can use the videos for guidance and kids too as the steps are easy to be followed. 
To add the story element but also the Covid-19 situation we are currently living in, we decided to have this web page dedicated to our character Peter who is bored from staying home all day because of this infection with the virus. In addition to the story element, for interaction, multiple elements were added. Buttons, alongside a change in element when hovering over different objects and interaction with video to start, were some of the interactive things we added to our webpage. Finally, for some extra touches, ads on the sides of the videos were added as some sort of a creative element for the user to interact with. We somehow wanted to mimic how web pages include side ads that distract the users away from watching the video.
# **Reflection/Evaluation: 
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version**
The goal of our project was to create a website with tutorial videos that target all ages. We believed that origami tutorial videos would provide people something exciting to do in the boring and hard times Covid 19 has been giving us. Because of this goal, we focused a lot on selecting a project users can engage in, along with elements of interactivity.
Users are able to drag hands onto the video screen to start the video. Users have buttons to click when they wish to go back to home and choose another video to watch. We believe that this created interactivity users can enjoy. 
Most importantly, we are happy to have delivered a project that will give some excitement to the audience and the users. We hope that with this project, more users will gain interest in origami and other indoors activities and keep themselves happy and safe until Covid 19 ends.
